 # The Prototype

 My prototype is a super quick FPS demo where you are able to shoot slimes in a basic environment.

 I used a couple of assets from the Unity Asset Store but all of the code was written myself (except for some stuff with the explosion prefab)

 In this project, I used NavMeshes to direct the enemy slimes around. 

 In terms of game design theory, I'm definitely keeping the mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics in mind. I'm designing with mechanics in mind first, and then working on the aesthetics later while still recognizing that is what the player will notice first. The most important element for my project at the moment is dynamics: how does it feel to play my prototype?
